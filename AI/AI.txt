I used the following workaround:

installed conda 4.5.11
installed with openssl conda install openssl
added openssl to PATH
updated conda conda update conda
updated everything else conda update --all


https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/4930

SET variable
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE: C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem

Set full permissions on Anaconda folder

That SSL error is misleading. I am using Anaconda 3, conda version 4.6.11, have the most current version of openssl on a Windows 10 instance. I got the issue resolved by changing the security settings on the Anaconda3 folder to Full Control. 
Don't think this helped, but I also have modified the ..\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem file to include the company's SSL cert. Instructions are here.
